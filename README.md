# Into The Forest: Nature's Food Chain Game

An AngularJS version of the [Into The Forest](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9581/forest) card game that we played in Mrs. Kohl's fourth grade class.

Set up as an ASP.Net 4 web site solution, but it's all JavaScript, so it's runnable off anything that's not file://.

I finished the game logic, scanned all the card images from an actual copy of the game I got off Ebay, and then couldn't get any inspiration for a good UI - so it's playable but not pretty, and it assumes you already know the rules. The two-player Showdown mode, by default, runs automatically with a rudimentary AI, so that's kinda neat.
